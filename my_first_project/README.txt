-Sleek and minimalistic.
-when hovering over something it pops and becomes darker, which looks pretty nice.
-I like how almost everything is flat, it lends to the minimalistic style
-I'd change the font colouring, as it is a little 'too' minimalistic, and doesn't grab my attention
-The drop down menu when you click on the top options is interesting, would help keep the ease of use pretty simple.

-Really like the side menu, makes it seem dynamic to me
-Having a smaller logo in the top right corner is a cool idea, but probably for us not on the main page
-Again has when a button is hovered over, it becomes grey, which I like
-It also shows a textbox when you hover over buttons. I think it might be cool to have when you hover over a
 that it give a brief description of where the button will lead you
